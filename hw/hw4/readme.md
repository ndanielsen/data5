###Part 3




		Part 3
		Use a plot to answer the following questions:

		-How are horsepower and displacement related?
		-What does the distribution of acceleration look like?
		-How is mpg spread for cars with different numbers of cylinders?
		-Do cars made before or after 1975 get better average mpg? (Hint: You need to 
		create a new column that encodes whether a year is before or after 1975.)
