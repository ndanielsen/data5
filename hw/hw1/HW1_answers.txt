Answers to HW 1 for DAT5
by Nathan Danielsen


Parts 1 and 2 are too verbose to print here 

PART3 : Average price per order is $18.8114285714 

PART4 : These are the sodas served: ['sprite', 'coke', 'lemonade', 'coca cola', 'diet dr. pepper', 'diet coke', 'dr. pepper', 'nestea', 'mountain dew'] 

PART5 : Average toppings per burrito is 5.39505119454 

PART6 : Chips Orders and Quantity of Order Type
	Chips and Roasted Chili-Corn Salsa : 18
	Chips and Tomatillo-Red Chili Salsa : 25
	Chips and Mild Fresh Tomato Salsa : 1
	Chips and Guacamole : 506
	Chips and Fresh Tomato Salsa : 130
	Chips and Tomatillo Red Chili Salsa : 50
	Chips and Tomatillo-Green Chili Salsa : 33
	Side of Chips : 110
	Chips and Roasted Chili Corn Salsa : 23
	Chips : 230
	Chips and Tomatillo Green Chili Salsa : 45


BONUS : My self-defined question was: 

Which types of proteins(Steak, Chicken, etc) have more fatty toppings defined as guacamole, sour cream and cheese?

Veggie as the 'main' topping was my control. 

The results are: 

	Steak orders have 1.84 average fatty toppings
	Chicken orders have 1.7 average fatty toppings
	Carnitas orders have 1.83 average fatty toppings
	Veggie orders have 1.75 average fatty toppings
	Barbacoa orders have 1.76 average fatty toppings


My conclusion is that people who order steak and carnitas dishes indulge a little more on fatty toppings. Chicken eaters are less likely to order fatty toppings and are probably watching their waistlines. 

Bene note: Too lazy to do a true statistical analysis with only built in python tools.
