Homework1:

Python exercises with Chipotle order data (listed at bottom of code file)

Work through GA's excellent introductory command line tutorial and then take this brief quiz.

Read through the course project requirements and start thinking about your own project!

# EXERCISE:
# create a list that contains the average number of incidents per distance
[(int(row[2]) + int(row[5])) / float(row[1])  for row in data]

A few extra things that will help you with the homework
'''

# 'in' statement is useful for lists
my_list = [1, 2, 1]
1 in my_list            # True
3 in my_list            # False

# 'in' is useful for strings (checks for substrings)
my_string = 'hello there'
'the' in my_string      # True
'then' in my_string     # False

# 'in' is useful for dictionaries (checks keys but not values)
my_dict = {'name':'Kevin', 'title':'instructor'}
'name' in my_dict       # True
'Kevin' in my_dict      # False

# 'set' data structure is useful for gathering unique elements
set(my_list)            # returns a set of 1, 2
len(set(my_list))       # count of unique elements

Homework with Chipotle data
https://github.com/TheUpshot/chipotle
'''

'''
PART 1: read in the data, parse it, and store it in a list of lists called 'data'
Hint: this is a tsv file, and csv.reader() needs to be told how to handle it
'''

'''
PART 2: separate the header and data into two different lists
'''

'''
PART 3: calculate the average price of an order
Hint: examine the data to see if the 'quantity' column is relevant to this calculation
Hint: work smarter, not harder! (this can be done in a few lines of code)
'''

'''
PART 4: create a list (or set) of all unique sodas and soft drinks that they sell
Note: just look for 'Canned Soda' and 'Canned Soft Drink', and ignore other drinks like 'Izze'
'''

'''
PART 5: calculate the average number of toppings per burrito
Note: let's ignore the 'quantity' column to simplify this task
Hint: think carefully about the easiest way to count the number of toppings
Hint: 'hello there'.count('e')
'''

'''
PART 6: create a dictionary in which the keys represent chip orders and
  the values represent the total number of orders
Expected output: {'Chips and Roasted Chili-Corn Salsa': 18, ... }
Note: please take the 'quantity' column into account!
Advanced: learn how to use 'defaultdict' to simplify your code

BONUS: think of a question about this data that interests you, and then answer it!
