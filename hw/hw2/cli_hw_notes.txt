Homework

For the following homework, please turn in the code used to generate the answer as well as the answer.

Using the command line, look at the file SMSSpamCollection.txt (Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00228/smsspamcollection.zip) in the data directory. It contains text messages that are labeled as spam or ham (the opposite of spam). Answer the following questions:

How many text messages are there?


What is the average number of words per text? What is the average number of characters per text?


How many messages are spam? How many are ham?

Is there a difference between the number of words per text and characters per text in messages that are spam vs. those that are ham? What are these numbers?

Bonus: If you feel that this is too easy, research the awk command to learn how to calculate and print out these averages in the console.

Separate the spam and ham messages into files "spam_messages.txt" and "ham_messages.txt".
